At the start of the MDG period, there was a complete lack of nationally representative data about drinking water safety in developing countries, and such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP developed the concept of �improved� water sources, which was used as a proxy for �safe water�, as such sources are likely to be protected against faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track progress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, availability and quality.\r\nThe above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of access and address safe management of drinking water services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality. The proposed indicator of �safely managed drinking water services� is designed to address this."

In the absence of such standards, reference is made to the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/guidelines/en/). \r\nE. coli or thermotolerant coliforms are the preferred indicator for microbiological quality, and arsenic and fluoride are the priority chemicals for global reporting."

These data sources often have information on the availability of water and increasingly on the quality of water at the household level, through direct testing of drinking water for faecal or chemical contamination. These data will be combined with data on availability and compliance with drinking water quality standards (faecal and chemical) from administrative reporting or regulatory bodies. \r\nThe WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) estimates access to basic services for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression line to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of �improved water� sources for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available.\r\nThe accompanying Methodological Note describes in more detail how data on availability and quality from different sources, can be combined with data on use of different types of supplies, as recorded in the current JMP database to compute the proposed indicator. \r\nhttp://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Methodological-note-on-monitoring-SDG-targets-for-WASH-and-wastewater_WHO-UNICEF_8October2015_Final.pdf."

Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to drinking water and sanitation is therefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,600 surveys, and for over 140 countries at least five data points are available which include information about basic water and sanitation for the period 1990-2015. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not usually collect information on basic access, estimates are drawn from administrative records. \r\nData on availability and faecal and chemical quality of drinking water, and regulation by appropriate authorities will be collected by JMP through consultation with the government departments responsible for drinking water supply and regulation. JMP routinely conducts country consultations with national authorities before publishing country estimates. Data on availability and quality of water supplies are currently available from household surveys or administrative sources including regulators for over 70 high-income countries, and at least 30-40 low- and middle-income countries. Thus, data are currently available from ca. 100 countries, covering the majority of the global population. This number will rise as regulation becomes more widespread in low- and middle-income countries.\r\nThe population data used by JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those routinely updated by the UN Population Division."

JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any. JMP has also developed an online tool to facilitate future data validation and expanded its online capabilities so that these reconciliations could be done in much more interactive and real time manner, reducing cost of reconciliations missions."
