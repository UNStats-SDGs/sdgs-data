There is only one threshold that divides youth and adults into above and below minimum level: \r\n(a) Below minimum level is the proportion or percentage of youth and adults who do not achieve the minimum standard as set-up by countries according to the globally defined minimum competencies. \r\n(b) Above minimum level is the proportion or percentage of youth and adults who have achieved the minimum standard. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will have to be mapped to the globally defined basic and proficiency levels. Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of youth and adults above and below minimum level."
