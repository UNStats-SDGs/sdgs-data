However, children are considered to be involved in child labour when they are either too young to work or are involved in activities harmful to their health and development. Children�s involvement in hazardous work can compromise their physical, mental, social and educational development.\r\nThe issue of child labour is guided by three main international conventions: ILO Convention No. 138 concerning minimum age for admission to employment and Recommendation No. 146 (1973); ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and Recommendation No. 190 (1999); and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 32), including its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. These conventions frame the concept of child labour and form the basis for child labour legislation enacted by countries that are signatories."

The resolution confirmed that any type of work (including involvement in household chores) undertaken by children should be considered in the measurement of child labour, in addition to economic activities. The target population for the resolution is children aged 5 to 17 years who, during a specified time period, were engaged in one or more of the following categories of activities: worst forms of child labour, employment below the minimum age, and unpaid household services. \r\nUNICEF�s standard indicator definition for child labour includes the following:\r\n� Age 5 to 11 years: At least 1 hour of economic work or 28 hours of unpaid household services per week.\r\n� Age 12 to 14 years: At least 14 hours of economic work or 28 hours of unpaid household services per week.\r\n� Age 15 to 17 years: At least 43 hours of economic or unpaid household services per week."

This exercise is done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. UNICEF Country Offices are invited to submit, through an online system, any updated data for a number of key indicators on the well-being of women and children. Updates sent by the country offices are then reviewed by sector specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality of the submitted estimates. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information is included in the databases. Once reviewed, feedback is made available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. New data points that are accepted are then entered into UNICEF�s global databases and published in the State of the World�s Children statistical tables, as well as in all other data-driven publications/material. The updated databases are also posted online at data.unicef.org.\r\nUNICEF also searches throughout the year for additional sources of data that are vetted by the UNICEF country office before they are included in the global databases."
