The better the relationship between all the relevant partners, the better the global partnership for sustainable development.\r\nThe indicator measures enhancement of the global partnership for sustainable development by looking at progress on a set of indicators that measure how development partners are working together. \r\nThe indicator takes account of the need to capture complementarity of multi-stakeholder partnerships by looking at frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant stakeholders. As the frameworks considered include multi-stakeholder participation in review of data, the indicator captures mobilization of expertise. The frameworks capture the quality of development cooperation with higher quality cooperation supporting mobilization of cooperation in the form of expertise, technology and finance. \r\nReflecting the spirit of the global partnership for sustainable development, and the universal nature of the SDGs, the collected data also monitors the contribution and behaviour of developed countries in achieving more effective, inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships to support and sustain the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, by measuring the quality of their development efforts."

There are other complementary efforts, such as the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by SEGIB, could also be considered."

Progress of developed countries in implementing development effectiveness commitments is captured through their partnership behaviour in those developing countries. Depending on each case, middle income countries that currently are both recipient and providers of development cooperation opt to report in their role as recipient and/or provider of development cooperation. Other developing and/or developed countries could be included through their future participation in the OECD and UNDP led data collection, or though their reporting to complementary monitoring frameworks on a regular basis."

The data can also be further disaggregated according to individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development cooperation) that are included within the multi- stakeholder frameworks.\r\nTo foster regional policy dialogue, disaggregation at the regional level is possible and encouraged. Some existing platforms are already using the evidence for regional monitoring, learning and policy discussions (e.g. NEPAD in Africa, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility in Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the UN Regional Economic Commissions).

Survey results are assessed in comprehensive studies, informing global monitoring and providing practical suggestions for improving development results. Synergies with the measurement of indicator 7 of the GPEDC monitoring framework are being used.
