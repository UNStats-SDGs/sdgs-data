                    "content": "This indicator measures the management response globally, by tracking invasive alien species legislation for control and prevention at national and international levels. The more countries with invasive alien species and biosecurity related legislation, the greater the global commitment to controlling the threat to biodiversity from invasive alien species. The larger the number of invasive alien species -relevant international policies, and the greater the level of national commitment to these, the greater the global commitment to controlling invasive alien species. The more international agreements a country is party to the more strongly committed the country is to controlling invasive alien species.\r\nThe global trend in policy response has been positive for the few last decades and, since the publication of GBO3, the adoption of policies against invasive alien species has significantly increased. As reported in 2010, 55% of the 191 countries that are Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity have overarching national legislation to prevent, control and/or limit the spread and impact of invasive alien species, and most Convention on Biological Diversity Parties were signatory to at least one of ten other multilateral agreements that cover invasive alien species in some form. Among these countries, 8% are signatory to all 10 international agreements (McGeoch et al. 2010). \r\nFor example, the Council of Europe has been developing and adopting codes of conduct addressing some key pathways (e.g. horticulture, botanic gardens, zoos, hunting, or fishing) of invasive alien species. Moreover, once the European regulation on invasive alien species is fully adopted, it will have major implications for neighbouring countries, but also at a world scale, as the European institution is a major partner for global trade.\r\nThe projection of the current trend of adoption of national policies on invasive alien species projects a nonsignificant increase by 2020, with a slowing of the rate of increase in the proportion of countries adopting such legislation. The adoption of national and international policies on invasive alien species is a first step to combatting the spread of invasive alien species.\r\nThe indicator is maintained by the IUCN Species Survival Commission�s Invasive Species Specialist Group.\r\nThis indicator is utilised for assessing progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020: \"by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment\" (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity�s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)."

                    "content": "An alien species is a species introduced by humans � either intentionally or accidentally � outside of its natural past or present distribution. However not all alien species have negative impacts, and it is estimated that between 5% and 20% of all alien species become problematic. It is these species that are termed �invasive alien species�. Thus, an invasive alien species (IAS) is a species that is established outside of its natural past or present distribution, whose introduction and/or spread threaten biological diversity."

If two separate sets of legislation within a country covered plants and animals, the date of the more recent legislation was used. Invasive alien species -related legislation is implemented through national Ministries of the Environment and a variety of other ministries and agencies."
