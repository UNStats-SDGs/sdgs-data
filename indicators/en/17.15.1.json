Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government�s planning documents. In practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.\r\nThe definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows for the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated Country Results Frameworks.\r\nThe broad definition of CRFs and CRF-like planning instruments include: long term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government�s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by providers, are not considered CRFs."

Weighting by project size would otherwise over represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available."
