This indicator casts light on the latter effect, being therefore a key measure of economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They can also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance affects living standards."

According to the System of National Accounts (SNA), \"GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output � GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers� prices, less the value of imports of goods and services    GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.\" \r\nReal Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The real GDP refers to the GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period.\r\nEmployed persons: Persons of working age (usually defined as persons aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as a day or a week, (i) did some work (even for just one hour) for pay, profit or family gain, in cash or in kind; or (ii) were attached to a job or had an enterprise from which they were �temporarily� absent during this period (for such reasons as illness, maternity, parental leave, holiday, training, industrial dispute)."

The Global Employment Trends Model (GET Model) is used to produce estimates, in particular, on labour productivity (among others). It uses multivariate regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level. The first step is to assemble every known piece of real information (i.e. every real data point), and keep only data that are national in coverage and comparable across countries and over time. This is an important selection criterion when GET Models are run, because they are designed to use the relationship between the various labour market indicators and their macroeconomic correlates � such as per capita GDP, GDP growth rates, demographic trends, country membership in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC), geographical indicators, and country and time dummy variables � in order to produce estimates of the labour market indicators where no data exist. Thus, the comparability of the labour market data that are used as inputs in the imputation models is essential to ensure that the models accurately capture the relationship between the labour market indicators and the macroeconomic variables. The last step of the estimation procedure occurs once the datasets containing both real and imputed labour market data have been assembled. In this step, the data are aggregated across countries to produce the final world and regional estimates. For further information on the GET Models, please refer to the technical background papers available at the following website: http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm."

In the absence of a household survey, establishment surveys, administrative records or official estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as population censuses. It is however important to note that employment data from establishment surveys will capture the number of jobs and not the number of persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, establishment surveys cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers and employees only, not accounting for the whole economy.\r\nWhen calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the coverage of the employment data is consistent with that of the national accounts."
