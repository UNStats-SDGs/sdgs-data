Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\".\r\nArticle 3, (b) states \"the consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used\";\r\nArticle 3, (c) states \"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered trafficking in persons even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a);\""

Furthermore, the list of exploitative forms is not limited, which means that other forms of exploitation may emerge and they could be considered to represent additional forms of trafficking offences."

However it does not cover the dark number of crime, i.e. the number of victims non detected by the authorities. While information on detected victims can provide valuable information to monitor sex and age profile of detected victims, as well as on forms of exploitation ,trafficking flows, the number of detected victims per se doesnï¿½t monitor the level of trafficking of persons so interpretation of trends should be done with caution, as changes in detected victims of trafficking can be due to multiple factors such as intensity of trafficking flows but also to changes of law enforcement practices, changes in legislation, or changes in victims attitudes,."
