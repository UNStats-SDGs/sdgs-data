(See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)\r\nOther official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf, Para 24).\r\nThe agriculture sector is as defined by the DAC and comprises all Creditor Reporting System (CRS) sector codes in the 311 series (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).\r\n�All donors� refers to DAC donors, non-DAC donors and multilateral organisations.
