It could also be used to monitor the implementation of these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular occupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide information for prevention purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations and economic activities whit the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety and reveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers� organizations, workers and workers� organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to provide a basis for policy-making aimed at encouraging employers, employers� organizations, workers and workers� organizations to introduce accident prevention measures."

Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer.\r\nOccupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. \r\nWorkers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the average number of workers in the particular group under consideration and who are covered by the source of the statistics on occupational injuries (for example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity, occupation, region, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered by a particular insurance scheme, accident notification systems, or household or establishment survey).\r\nFatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident.\r\nCase of fatal occupational injury: the case of a worker fatally injured as a result of one occupational accident, and where death occurred within one year of the day of the accident."

Under reporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development, but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analyzing the data. \r\nDouble-counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics.\r\nBecause data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyze indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed."

                    "content": "The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be calculated separately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a different source than those on non-fatal injuries, which would make their sum into total occupational accidents inaccurate.\r\nThe fatal occupational injury frequency rate is calculated as the number of new cases of fatal injury during the reference year divided by the total number of hours worked by workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 1 000 000. \r\nSimilarly, the non-fatal occupational injury frequency rate is calculated as the number of new cases of non-fatal injury during the reference year divided by the total number of hours worked by workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 1 000 000. \r\nIdeally, the denominator should be the number of hours actually worked by workers in the reference group. When this is not possible, the denominator can be calculated on the basis of normal hours of work taking into account entitlements to periods of paid absence from work, such as paid vacations, paid sick leave and public holidays. \r\nIf the data needed to calculate frequency rates is not available, incidence rates may be calculated instead.\r\nThe fatal occupational injury incidence rate is calculated as the number of new cases of fatal injury during the reference year divided by the average number of workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 100 000.\r\nSimilarly, the non-fatal occupational injury incidence rate is calculated as the number of new cases of non-fatal injury during the reference year divided by the average number of workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 100 000.\r\nIn calculating the average number of workers, the number of part-time workers should be converted to full-time equivalents. For the calculation of rates, the numerator and the denominator should have the same coverage. For example, if self-employed persons are not covered by the source of statistics on fatal occupational injuries, they should also be taken out of the denominator."
