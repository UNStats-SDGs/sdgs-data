In some countries, the upper parts of this �ladder� are organized programmes of joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school and university system.\r\nNon-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages. Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture."
