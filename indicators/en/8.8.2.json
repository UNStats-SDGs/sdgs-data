This indicator is based on coding the findings of selected sources and compiling this information in a readily accessible and concise manner. It builds on five basic elements: the premises of definitional validity, reproducibility and transparency; the 108 evaluation criteria used to code violations in law and practice (each with their own specific detailed definitions); the textual sources selected for coding; the general and source-specific coding rules; and the rules to convert the coded information into normalized indicators."

Weights for these evaluation criteria are assigned based on the use of the Delphi survey method of expert consultation. Indicator are normalized to range zero to 10 (best to worst possible score) with breakdowns for overall freedom of association and collective bargaining rights as well as these rights in law and in practice. The database for the indicators is constructed such that coding of any given violations can be quickly traced back to the full text on which the coding is based, for each of the individual textual sources. The rules used for coding and the underlying methodology can be found at http://labour-rights-indicators.la.psu.edu/about. A Methodological paper is currently available in the IAEG-SDG metadata already submitted."

These sources are all ILO sources coming from the ILO supervisory mechanisms and their databases. The coding is being done by a joint group of the ILO and Penn University.
