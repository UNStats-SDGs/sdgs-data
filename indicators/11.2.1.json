The accessibility based urban mobility paradigm also critically needs good, high-capacity public transport systems that are well integrated in a multimodal arrangement with public transport access points located within comfortable walking or cycling distances from homes and jobs for all. \r\nThe ability of residents including persons with disabilities and businesses to access markets, employment opportunities, and service centers such as schools and hospitals is critical to urban economic development. The transport system provides access to resources and employment opportunity. Moreover, accessibility allows planners to measure the effects of changes in transport and land use systems. The accessibility of jobs, services and markets also allow policymakers, citizens and businesses to discuss the state of the transport system in the comprehensible way. The transportation system is a critical enabler of economic activities and social inclusion. The access to transport SDG indicator addresses a significant gap that was never addressed by the MDGs, i.e. directly addressing transport as a critical enabler of economic activities and social inclusion. Already, the \"externalities\" associated with transport in terms of Green House Gas Emissions, traffic congestion and road traffic accidents have been increasing. Emissions from transport are now responsible for 23% of global Green House Gas Emissions and are increasing faster than any other source; outdoor air pollution alone, a major source of which is transport, is responsible for 3.7 million deaths annually, road traffic accidents kill more than 1.2 million people every year and severe traffic congestion is choking cities and impacting on GDPs. Achieving SDG 11 requires a fundamental shift in the thinking on transport- with the focus on the goal of transport rather than on its means. With accessibility to services, goods and opportunities for all as the ultimate goal, priority is given to making cities more compact and walkable through better planning and the integration of land-use planning with transport planning. The means of transport are also important but the SDG�s imperative to make the city more inclusive means that cities will have to move away from car-based travel to public transport and active modes of transport such as walking and cycling with good inter-modal connectivity. \r\nThe rising traffic congestion levels and the resulting negative air quality in many metropolitan areas have elevated the need for a successful public transportation system to ease the reliance on the private means of transportation. Cities that choose to invest in effective public transportation options stand out to gain in the long-run. Cities that have convenient access to public transport, including access by persons with disabilities are more preferred as these are more likely to offer lower transportation costs while improving on the environment, congestion and travel times within the city. At the same time, improving the access to areas with a high proportion of transport disadvantaged groups such as elderly citizens, physically challenged individuals, and low income earners or areas with specific dwelling types such as high occupancy buildings or public housing also helps increase the efficiency and the sustainability of the public transport system. Public transport is a very important equalizer of income, consumption and spatial inequalities. This indicator is empirically proven that public transport make cities more inclusive, safe and sustainable. Effective and low-cost transportation is critical for reducing urban poverty and inequalities and enhancing economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, education services and other public goods. \r\nClean public transport is a very efficient mean for the reduction of CO2 emissions and therefore it contributes to climate change and lower levels of energy consumption. Most importantly public transport need to be easily accessible to the elderly and disabled citizens."

                    "content": "This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport. Because most public transport users walk from their trip origins to public transport stops and from public transport stops to their trip destination, local spatial availability and accessibility is sometimes evaluated in terms of pedestrian (walk) access, as opposed to park and ride or transfers.\r\nHence, the access to public transport is considered convenient when an officially recognized stop is accessible within a distance of 0.5 km from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include:\r\na. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.\r\nb. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times\r\nc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environment\r\nPublic transport is defined as a shared passenger transport service that is available to the general public. It includes cars, buses, trolleys, trams, trains, subways, and ferries that are shared by strangers without prior arrangement. However, it excludes taxis, car pools, and hired buses, which are not shared by strangers without prior arrangement. It also excludes informal, unregulated modes of transport (para-transit), motorcycle taxis, three-wheelers, etc.\r\nPublic transport refers to a public service that is considered as a public good that has well designed �stops� for passengers to embark and disembark in a safe manner and demarcated �routes� that are both officially and/or formally recognized.\r\nAdditional methodological comments:\r\nThe method to estimate the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport is based on four steps: \r\na) Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration: \r\nDelimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration and calculate the total area (square kilometres). Area of delimitation should be aligned with census enumeration areas to match with demographic data.\r\nb) Inventory of the public transport stops in the city or the service area: \r\nInformation can be obtained from city administration or service providers. In some cases where this information is lacking, incomplete or outdated, open sources and community-based maps, which are increasingly recognized as a valid source of information, can be a viable alternative.\r\nWhen information is available, characteristics of the quality, universal accessibility for people with disabilities, safety, and frequency of the service can be �assigned� to the public transport stops� inventory for detailed analysis and further disaggregation according to the statistical capacities of countries and cities. \r\nc) Estimation of urban area with access to public transport:\r\nTo calculate the indicator it is necessary to use a map with the inventory of officially-recognized public transport stops and create a buffer area of 500m radius for each stop. Merge and clip with boundary of the boundary built-up area of the urban agglomeration.\r\nd) Estimation of the proportion of the population with convenient access out of the total population of the city:\r\nOverlay GIS demographic data on the number of dwellings within the area with access to public transport stop. Calculate the population within those dwellings. Estimate the proportion of population out of the total population of the city.\r\nComplementary to the above, other parameters of tracking the transport target include the following:\r\na) Accessibility related to urban planning: this parameter can be measured using density (people/sq.km) from census surveys, Percentage of street space in cities and Number of Intersections / Sq.Km from analysis of earth observations and/or city maps. Density is an important determinant for the efficiency of public transport systems. The adequacy of streets and crossings determine urban accessibility to a great extent. \r\nb) Accessibility related to transport planning: this parameter can be measured using Percentage of population within 500m of mass transit stop from City maps and sample survey data.\r\nc) Affordability: this can be obtained from Percentage of household income of lowest quintile of population spent on transport from Sample surveys and WTP surveys. Poorest quintile should not spend more than 5% (TBD) on transport.\r\nd) Quality: this parameter can be measured using travel time, universal access, safety, security, comfort and user information from sample surveys.\r\ne) Modal shift to sustainable transport: this is also expressed in Modal share (cars, NMT, PT), Passenger KM travelled on EV as percentage of total passenger KM travelled in urban areas from City mobility surveys. This parameter is also important due to transport�s contribution to carbon emissions and air quality issues in cities."

Harmonized global/local data on urban transport systems do not exist, nor are they comparable at the world level.\r\nIt is recognized that convenience measured as distance does not categorize the quality of the public transport which will vary from country to country. Nevertheless, the proposed indicator is a comparable and objective measurement that can be assessed in cities across regions.\r\nOther factors of this indicator such as affordability, safety, and universal accessibility may influence the usage of public means of mobility beyond proximity to the transport stop. Yet, the provision of widely accessible public transport is a precondition for its usage.\r\nFinally, high capacity public transport, such as trains allows for a larger capture area, beyond the 0.5km of the proposed indicator.\r\nIt is also recognized that there are various forms of public transport in the member countries that are not fully defined or captured in this methodology. In particular, many developing countries have access to public transport that is available anywhere on the streets and not necessarily at designated public transport stops. The creation of designated stops is a precondition of measurement in these countries."

                    "label": "Computation Method",
                    "content": "Method of Computation\r\nThis indicator is computed based on the following criteria:\r\nThe identification of service areas is typically achieved using the buffering operation (using GIS) by constructing lines of equal proximity around each public transport stop or each public transport route. The buffering operation clearly involves at least two decisions. The first decision is whether routes or stops should be used as the reference of measurement. The two approaches may lead to very different values of spatial availability. But generally, public transport stops offer a more appropriate basis than routes for estimating service area coverage because stops are the actual locations where public transport users access the system. The other decision involved in the buffering operation is the buffer size. A common practice in public transport planning is to assume that people are served by public transport if they are within 0.5km (or 500m) of either a public transport route or stop. Once a distance threshold is defined, buffers are created around the public transport features. Some studies measure the distance based on air, or Euclidean, distance, while others use network distance (that is, the walk distance computed using the street network to reach a public transport feature. Since the network distance between two locations in space is greater than, or equal to, the corresponding air distance, the size of a coverage area defined by the network distance will be smaller than, or equal to, that defined by air distance. Network distance measures are likely to be more realistic because they reflect the configuration of the street network and recognize the presence of any man-made barriers preventing direct access to public transport features. In addition to using the above mentioned distance measures, others have suggested the use of travel time to public transport features as a measure of proximity. Using travel time is preferable to distance as a measure of proximity because travel time measures account for such pedestrian-unfriendly factors such as steep terrains. However, because of the additional data requirements and the amount of processing effort involved, travel time measures are rarely used in practice. For this indicator  the public transport stop will be used as the point of service.\r\nThe identification of the population served\r\nOnce a service buffer is constructed, the next step is to overlay the buffer onto other polygons, such as census tracts, for which socio-demographic data (such as population figures, disabled persons, type of residence area, etc. is available. These polygons are referred to as the analysis zones. Typically, a service buffer (denoted as i) intersects, either fully or partially, with more than one analysis zone j ( j=1�..J). The population served by the public transport service in buffer i, Pi, is thus equal to the sum of the population in each of the intersecting areas, Pij . Hence\r\nPi=?_(j=1)^J�Pij\r\nWhere, Pij is estimated based on the amount of interaction between service buffer i and analysis zone j.\r\nIn estimating Pij it is assumed that the population is uniformly distributed within the analysis zones.\r\nIntegrating local temporal availability.\r\nThe methodology described above covers public transport service solely based on spatial access to stops or routes and does not address the temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. We note that temporal aspect of public transport availability is important because a service within walking distance is not necessarily considered as available if waiting times go beyond a certain threshold level that is required. This wait time for public transport is related to the frequency of the service as well as the threshold for tolerable waits for potential public transport users. We will leave out completely the temporal measurement for global comparison, but countries that can additionally capture this component are encouraged to collect and report this information as part of the disaggregation.\r\nFinally, the population with access to public transport out of the entire city population will be computed as;\r\n Percentage with access to Public transport =100x (population with convenient access to Public transport)/(City Population)"

This tool was developed by the World Bank in conjunction with Conveyal (http://conveyal.com), this tool leverages the power of the OTPA engine and open standardized data to model block-level accessibility.
