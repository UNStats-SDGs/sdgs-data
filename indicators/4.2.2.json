Early childhood and primary education programmes are examples of organized learning programmes. \r\nEarly childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children�s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation. \r\nThe official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in the country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this indicator at the global level."

The indicator measures the percentage of children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity of the programme, which limits the ability to draw conclusions on the extent to which this target is being achieved. More work is needed to ensure that the definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally with complementary information collected on the amount of time children spend in learning programmes."

Where this is not possible the UIS imputes missing values for use only for calculating regional and global aggregates.\r\nFor the purposes of calculating participation rates by age, the UIS may make one or more of the following:\r\n� An adjustment to account for over- or under-reporting, for example:\r\no To include enrolments in a type of education � such as private education or special education � not reported by the country; and/or \r\no To include enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the country.\r\n� An estimate of the number of enrolments in the given age group if the age distribution was not reported by the country\r\n� A redistribution of enrolments of unknown age (across known ages)\r\n� An estimate of the population in the official age group for small countries (if neither the UN Population Division nor the country itself can provide estimates of their own).\r\nIn all cases estimates are based on evidence from the country itself (eg information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the Ministry�s or National Statistical Office�s Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organizations) or on data from the country for a previous year. These figures may be published: (i) as observed data if the missing items are found in a national source; (ii) as national estimates if the country is persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data; or (iii) as UIS estimates, if the estimates are made by the UIS.\r\nThe age distribution of enrolments is most commonly estimated from the age distribution reported in a previous year. If the country has never reported the age distribution of enrolments, the age distribution reported in another survey, if available, is used (such as Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) or Demographic Health Surveys (DHS)).\r\nEnrolments of unknown age are redistributed across known ages if they constitute more than 5% of the total enrolments in that level of education. No estimation is made if they are 5% or less.\r\nPopulation estimates by age for countries with small population � produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either from UNPD or from the country itself � are made only for countries which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population estimates from a reliable source are available in some years."

Publishable data are the data submitted to the UIS by Member States or the result of an explicit estimation made by the Institute based on pre-determined standards. In both cases, these data are sent to Member States for review before they are considered publishable by the UIS. \r\nWhen data are not available for all countries, the UIS imputes national data for the sole purpose of calculating regional averages. These imputed data are not published nor otherwise disseminated. \r\nWhere data are available for a country for both an earlier and a more recent year than the missing year, a simple linear interpolation is made. Where data are only available for an earlier year, the most recent value is used as an estimate. Similarly, where data are only available for a more recent year, the last value is used as an estimate.\r\nWhere the relevant data are not available at all for a country, estimates may be based on another variable which is clearly linked to the item being estimated. For example, enrolments by age may be based on total enrolments.\r\nWhere no data are available for the country in any year that can inform the estimate, the unweighted average for the region in which the country lies is used."
