Known as the End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to \"End the global tuberculosis epidemic\", and correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs. \r\nThe tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-diagnosis of cases."
