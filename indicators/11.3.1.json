Computing the population growth rate is more straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes \"consumption\" of land since this may cover aspects of \"consumed\" or \"preserved\" or available for \"development\" for cases such as land occupied by wetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly \"newly-developed\" (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially \"redeveloped\". As a result, the percentage of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also sometimes referred to as built up area."

                    "content": "Globally, land cover today is altered principally by direct human use: by agriculture and livestock raising, forest harvesting and management and urban and suburban construction and development. A defining feature of many of the world�s cities is an outward expansion far beyond formal administrative boundaries, largely propelled by the use of the automobile, poor urban and regional planning and land speculation. A large proportion of cities both from developed and developing countries have high consuming suburban expansion patterns, which often extend to even further peripheries. A global study on 120 cities shows that urban land cover has, on average, grown more than three times as much as the urban population [1]; in some cases similar studies at national level showed a difference that was three to five times fold. [3]. In order to effectively monitor land consumption growth, it is not only necessary to have the information on existing land use cover but also the capability to monitor the dynamics of land use resulting out of both changing demands of increasing population and forces of nature acting to shape the landscape.\r\nCities require an orderly urban expansion that makes the land use more efficient. They need to plan for future internal population growth and city growth resulting from migrations. They also need to accommodate new and thriving urban functions such as transportation routes, etc., as they expand. However, frequently the physical growth of urban areas is disproportionate in relation to population growth, and these results in land use that is less efficient in many forms. This type of growth turns out to violate every premise of sustainability that an urban area could be judged by including impacting on the environment and causing other negative social and economic consequences such as increasing spatial inequalities and lessening of economies of agglomeration.\r\nThis indicator is connected to many other indicators of the SDGs. It ensures that the SDGs integrate the wider dimensions of space, population and land adequately, providing the framework for the implementation of other goals such as poverty, health, education, energy, inequalities and climate change. The indicator has a multipurpose measurement as it is not only related to the type/form of the urbanization pattern. It is also used to capture various dimensions of land use efficiency: economic (proximity of factors of production); environmental (lower per capita rates of resource use and GHG emissions); social (reduced travel distance and cost expended). Finally, this indicator integrates an important spatial component and is fully in line with the recommendations made by the Data Revolution initiative."

It reflects the number of births and deaths during a period and the number of people migrating to and from a country.\r\nLand consumption includes: (a) The expansion of built-up area which can be directly measured; (b) the absolute extent of land that is subject to exploitation by agriculture, forestry or other economic activities; and (c) the over-intensive exploitation of land that is used for agriculture and forestry."

                    "content": "In some cases, it is difficult to measure the urban expansion by conurbations of two or more urban areas that are in close proximity; to whom to attribute the urban growth and how to include it as one metric usually becomes a challenge. At the same time, data would not always coincide to administrative levels, boundaries and built-up areas. However, the European Commission highlights some possible drawbacks of this indicator that can be technically addressed. Efforts to use the area of reference at the level of the built-up area of the urban agglomeration should be taken into consideration. The delimitation of city boundaries may be another methodological problem that a clear agreed definition can solve.\r\nThe indicator may experience difficulties in capturing cities with negative or zero population growth; or cities that due to severe disaster have lost part of their territories. To face this challenge, the baseline/benchmark of population density and its change over time must be taken into consideration. Reducing densities below sustainable levels have impacts on the cities� sustainability.\r\nIn the absence of the GIS layers, this indicator may not be computed as defined. As a result more alternative measures for land that is developed or consumed per year can be adequately used. Alternatively, one can monitor the efficient use of urban land by measuring how well we are achieving the densities in residential zones that any city plans or international guidance call for. Comparing achieved to planned densities is very useful at the city level. However, planned densities vary greatly from country to country, and at times from city to city. At the sub-regional or city levels, it is more appropriate to compare average densities achieved currently to those achieved in the recent past. While building more densely does use land more efficiently, high density neighborhoods, especially in and around urban centers, have a number of other advantages. They support more frequent public transportation, and more local stores and shops; they encourage pedestrian activity to and from local establishments; and they create lively (and sometimes safer) street life."

Already some spatial noise is particularly created by the use of ratios. The following data sources will be harmonized to ensure more consistent reporting on this indicator--Satellite data, built-up areas grids, time-standardized census population grids; globally complete classification grids can be aggregated to admin units but may create inconsistencies if they are not available for all cities, allowing to classify them by dominance of the urban/rural surfaces or similar approaches."

Several sources of information are required for this computation: Satellite imagery from open sources or the exact measurements in km squared of the built up areas or the land that is fully developed in Km squared, annual urban population data for the reference years of analysis.\r\nData for the size of the city land that is currently considered as developed is usually available from the urban planning units of the cities. New options using remote sensing techniques have also been developed to estimate the land that is currently developed or considered as built up areas out of the total city land. This option also accurately extracts land that is considered as wetlands and hence unlikely to be occupied now or in the future.\r\nWhen the spatial measurement option is used, the use of the urban agglomeration (built-up area) is a precondition for the measurement and comparability of this indicator. Data for this indicator can be easily availed using global and local sources. The indicator has been collected and analyzed since 2000 by several municipalities and countries. Various governments (Mexico, Colombia Brazil, India, Ethiopia, etc., and most European countries) have collected data on this indicator recently.\r\nEurostat collects data on this indicator using other comparable techniques. World Bank and Lincoln Institute collected data for 120 cities and published it in the Atlas of Urban Expansion. [02]. Currently UN-Habitat, Lincoln Institute and New York University prepared a similar study for another 200 cities.\r\nUN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative is collecting data on this indicator for nearly 300 cities as part of the Agency�s efforts to integrate spatial analysis in the SDGs."
