Internet is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer) and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or via mobile network.\r\nComputers for pedagogical use: Use of computers to support course delivery or independent teaching and learning needs. This may include activities using computers or the Internet to meet information needs for research purposes; develop presentations; perform hands-on exercises and experiments; share information; and participate in online discussion forums for educational purposes. A computer is a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve and process data, as well as share information in a highly-structured manner. It performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations according to a set of instructions or algorithms. Computers include the following types:\r\n- A desktop computer usually remains fixed in one place; normally the user is placed in front of it, behind the keyboard;\r\n- A laptop computer is small enough to carry and usually enables the same tasks as a desktop computer; it includes notebooks and netbooks but does not include tablets and similar handheld devices; and\r\n- A tablet (or similar handheld computer) is a computer that is integrated into a flat touch screen, operated by touching the screen rather than using a physical keyboard.\r\nAdapted infrastructure is defined as any built environment related to education facilities that are accessible to all users, including those with different types of disability, to be able to gain access to use and exit from them. Accessibility includes ease of independent approach, entry, evacuation and/or use of a building and its services and facilities (such as water and sanitation), by all of the building's potential users with an assurance of individual health, safety and welfare during the course of those activities . \r\nAdapted materials include learning materials and assistive products that enable students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations to access learning and to participate fully in the school environment. \r\nAccessible learning materials include textbooks, instructional materials, assessments and other materials that are available and provided in appropriate formats such as audio, braille, sign language and simplified formats that can be used by students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations. \r\nBasic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking water source (MDG �improved� categories) on or near the premises and water points accessible to all users during school hours. \r\nBasic sanitation facilities are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG �improved� categories) separated for males and females on or near the premises. \r\nBasic handwashing facilities are defined as functional handwashing facilities, with soap and water available to all girls and boys."

Where data are only available for an earlier year, the most recent value is used as an estimate. Similarly, where data are only available for a more recent year, the last value is used as an estimate.\r\nWhere the relevant data are not available at all for a country, estimates may be based on another variable which is clearly linked to the item being estimated. For example, schools with access to basic services or facilities may be estimated from the total number of schools.\r\nWhere no data are available for the country in any year that can inform the estimate, the unweighted average for the region in which the country lies is used.\r\nCurrently no estimates are made for this indicator for the purpose of having publishable country-level data."

Data on adapted infrastructure are not collected currently. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators.\r\nThe data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.\r\nIn addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual \"country review\" of indicators."
