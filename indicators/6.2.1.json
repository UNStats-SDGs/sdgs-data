                    "content": "MDG target 7C called for �sustainable access� to �basic sanitation�. The JMP developed the metric of use of �improved� sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards.\r\nThe above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or transport of wastes to designated treatment sites. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment).\r\nHandwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In 2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that the most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household surveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the presence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether households have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by survey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing behaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour."

For example, with the new SDG indicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a common practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services.\r\nTreated offsite; not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment plant. For instance, a portion may leak from the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. Similarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to open ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once the excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment equipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of SDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will be assessed through consideration of both the overall treatment effectiveness and end-use/disposal arrangements.\r\nA handwashing facility with soap and water: a handwashing facility is a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing. This indicator is a proxy of actual handwashing practice, which has been found to be more accurate than other proxies such as self-reports of handwashing practices."

This approach was used to report on use of �improved sanitation� facilities for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available.\r\nThe Methodological Note describes in more detail how estimates of the proportion of household wastewater that is safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site will be combined with data on use of different types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the current JMP database. \r\nhttp://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Methodological-note-on-monitoring-SDG-targets-for-WASH-and-wastewater_WHO-UNICEF_8October2015_Final.pdf"

Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to sanitation is therefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,600 surveys, and for over 140 countries at least five data points are available which include information about basic water and sanitation for the period 1990-2015. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not usually collect information on basic access, estimates are drawn from administrative records.\r\nEstimates of excreta management will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of basic sanitation facilities as needed. Administrative, population and environmental data can also be combined to estimate safe disposal or transport of excreta, when no country data are available. Data on disposal or treatment of excreta are limited but estimates for safe management of faecal wastes can be calculated based on faecal waste flows associated with the use of different types of basic sanitation facility.\r\nSince the handwashing with soap survey questions were standardized in 2009, over 50 DHS and MICS surveys have included the module. JMP published handwashing data from 12 countries in its 2014 update report, and for 54 countries in the 2015 report.\r\nThe population data used by JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those established by the UN Population Division."

JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any. JMP has also developed an online tool to facilitate future data validation and expanded its online capabilities so that these reconciliations could be done in much more interactive and real time manner, reducing cost of reconciliations missions."
