It is important to note that the extent to which information on specific transfers and programs is captured in the household surveys can vary a lot across countries. Often household surveys do not capture the universe of social protection and labor (SPL) programs in the country, in best practice cases just the largest programs. Many household surveys have limited information on SPL programs, some surveys collect information only on participation without including the transfer amounts; and others include program information mixed with private transfers, making it difficult to isolate individual SPL programs.\r\nTherefore information on country SPL programs included in ASPIRE is limited to what is captured in the respective national household survey and does not necessarily represent the universe of programs existing in the country. In addition, the availability of ASPIRE indicators depends on the type of questions included in the survey. If transfer amounts are available, for example, adequacy and impact on poverty indicators can be generated. If only program participation questions are included in the survey, only non-monetary indicators can be generated such as coverage or beneficiary incidence.\r\nAs a consequence, ASPIRE performance indicators are not fully comparable across harmonized program categories and countries.\r\nHowever, household surveys have the unique advantages of allowing analysis of program impact on household welfare. With such caveats in mind, ASPIRE indicators based on household surveys provide an approximate measure of social protection systems performance."

The ASPIRE team harmonizes these household surveys to make them reasonably comparable across country and over time.\r\nThe ASPIRE harmonization methodology for household survey data rests on the following three steps:\r\n1. Identification and classification of Social Protection and Labor (SPL) benefits and services\r\nHousehold surveys are carefully reviewed to identify SPL program information. Once this information is located, two levels of analysis are implemented: first, variables are created for each of the country specific programs found in the survey. If the original program name is not provided in the survey instrument, the variable will report the corresponding ASPIRE�s program subcategories according to how the question is framed and country context.\r\nAdditionally, program variables are aggregated and harmonized into 12 SPL program categories, and 2 private transfer categories. The country specific programs included into these main SPL categories are documented in detail below and are validated with WB country task teams in close coordination with national counterparts.\r\nIn order to generate the indicators, the following variables are also harmonized: household identification number, location (urban/rural), household size, adult equivalent household size, welfare aggregate, household weight and poverty line, defined as the poorest 20% of the welfare distribution.\r\n2. Welfare aggregates\r\nHouseholds are ranked in quintiles of the welfare distribution (either household total income or consumption). Special efforts are made to include the most recently updated welfare aggregates officially agreed with National Statistical Offices and /or harmonized by regional poverty teams (or the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean - SEDLAC) in the case of Latin American countries and the ECAPOV database in the case of Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries. These welfare aggregates are also consistent with the ones used by World Bank PovcalNet poverty estimates.\r\n3. PPP conversions\r\nAll monetary variables (transfer amounts) and the welfare aggregate are deflated to 2005 values and then converted to international US Dollars according to the following: [all transfers and welfare (t) / CPI (2005)] / [ICP (2005)] where ICP (2005) is the PPP conversion factor base 2005 of private consumption.\r\nOnce the information is harmonized performance indicators are generated using ADePT SP software."
