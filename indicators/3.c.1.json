The former includes total population counts (such as the census) and data on representative populations or sub-populations (such as labour force and employment surveys). Institution-based sources include health facility assessments (HFA) and routine administrative records (RAR), which comprise records on public expenditure, staffing and payroll, professional training, registration and licensure. \r\nIn cases where the official health workforce report provide density indicators instead of counts, estimates\r\nof the stock were then calculated using the population estimated from the United Nations Population\r\nDivision's World population prospects database (2010).\r\nFollowing the adoption of the Global strategy on human resources for health: workforce 2030 and resolution (WHA 69.19) to address human resources for health (HRH) challenges at the 69th World Health Assembly, May 2016, Member States are called on to consolidate a core set of human resources for health data with annual reporting to the Global Health Observatory, as well as progressive implementation of national health workforce accounts, to support national policy and planning and the Global Strategyï¿½s monitoring and accountability framework."
