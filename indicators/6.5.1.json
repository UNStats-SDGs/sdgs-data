IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as \"a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.\" (GWP 2010). \r\nThe method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992)."

The percentage score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with �0� interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and �100� interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented. \r\nTo further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized in a similar way to the survey questions: Degree of implementation = \r\nNot relevant: Very low (0-9.9)\r\nUnder development: Low (10-29.9)\r\nDeveloped, not implemented: Medium-low (30-49.9)\r\nImplementation started: Medium-high (50-69.9)\r\nImplemented, advanced: High (70-89.9)\r\n Fully implemented: Very high (90-100)\r\nThe concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. \r\nCountries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. \r\nIndicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 \"Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation\", which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 \"�, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.\"."

Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. \r\n4. Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.\r\nThe indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is split into two parts: questions concerning the �National level� and �Other levels� respectively. �Other levels� includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 �implement [IWRM] at all levels ��."

The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of \"leaving no on behind\"."

This provides countries with a quick assessment of which aspects of IWRM are progressing well, and which aspects require increased efforts to obtain the target. \r\nThe nature of the target, indicator and survey does not lend itself to disaggregation by sex, age group, income etc. However, social equality is an integral part of IWRM, and there are questions which directly address issues such as gender, vulnerable groups, geographic coverage and broad stakeholder participation in water resources development and management. These questions provide an indication of the national and sub-national situation regarding social equality."

The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water issues, and water management issues in particular, cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the questionnaire. \r\nThe ministry may wish to nominate a national \"IWRM focal point\", who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a �ladder� approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. \r\n1) The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score, \r\n2) The completed draft questionnaire is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. \r\n3) The revised draft questionnaire is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email, online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. \r\n4) The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version will be the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. Countries can enter responses electronically into an online version of the survey, which will automatically calculate the degree of IWRM implementation score, and also generate graphs and automatic reports to help countries identify areas for attention. \r\n5) The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. \r\nBased on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. \r\nTemporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended."
