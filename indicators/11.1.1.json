                    "content": "As the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are turning a page, the unprecedented proliferation of slums and informal settlements, and a chronic lack of adequate housing, continue to be amongst the major challenges of urbanization. Slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing are the face of poverty and inequality in cities, and no transformative action will be achieved in the world without addressing the challenge of urban poverty represented by them. Therefore, it is necessary to further ensure access for all to adequate housing and basic services and upgrade slums, for the full recognition of the urban poor as rightful urban dwellers, for realizing their potential and for enhancing their prosperity, and thus the prosperity of the whole urban environ.\r\nThis indicator is extremely relevant since it is partly a continuation of the MDGs (Target 7.D). As per all the agreed goals and targets, to measure the achievement of this indicator will require the mobilisation of the means required to efficiently monitor them, calling up for a revitalised partnership with the participation of all countries, all stakeholders and all communities concerned.\r\nToday, in our world, one in eight people live in slums (UN-Habitat, 2016; UN-Habitat, 2015b). This means that a quarter of the world�s urban population are slum dwellers. In several cities, poor families struggle to access adequate housing. Living in central locations often equals to inadequate living conditions, while living in peripheries, where housing can be more affordable, entails deprivation of basic services, urban amenities and access to livelihoods.\r\nSlum upgrading and adequate housing have an equalizing impact in the distribution of prosperity, thus helping urban environs to be inclusive and end urban poverty in the world.\r\nIn order to address the wording proposed by Target 11.1 and Indicator 11.1, and to provide a statistical continuity between MDGs and SDGs in what refers to the people living in slums, the five components of the �slum household� definition (access to water, access to sanitation, structural durability, overcrowding and security of tenure) must form the basis to monitor SDG 11 Target 11.1, complemented by the extra indicators that will allow measurements referring to informal settlements and inadequate housing, respectively.\r\nOne extra indicator for inadequate housing and one for informal settlements � totaling seven variables to be measured � could keep the tracking of this target manageable. In the case of informal settlements, the existence of a municipal permit is a workable means of measurement, while inadequate housing could be effectively measured through affordability criteria, as at least 330 million households around the world are financially stretched by housing costs (McKinsey Global Institute, 2014)."

                    "content": "a. Slums � In the wake of the MDGs� launching, an Expert Group Meeting was convened in 2002 by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D, �to have achieved by 2020 a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers�. The agreed definition classified a �slum household� as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following �household deprivations�: 1) Lack of access to improved water source, 2) Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3) Lack of sufficient living area, 4) Lack of housing durability and, 5) Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term �slum dweller� refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes (UN-Habitat, 2003a).\r\nThese five components � all derived from the �adequate housing� definition (see below) � have been used, ever since for reporting and tracking of the MDGs, as the primary or secondary data measured to determine the number of slum dwellers living in developing countries, and they were also the basis to establish the successful achievement of MDG Target 7.D. For each component, the experts agreed with the following definitions (UN-Habitat, 2003b; United Nations, 2007):\r\nAccess to improved water � A household is considered to have access to improved drinking water if it has sufficient amount of water (20 litres/person/day) for family use, at an affordable price (less than 10% of the total household income) and available to household members without being subject to extreme effort (less than one hour a day for the minimum sufficient quantity), especially to women and children. An improved drinking water source is a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters� contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and, protected dug well.\r\nAccess to improved sanitation � A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation if an excreta disposal system, either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a reasonable number of people, is available to household members. Such improved sanitation facilities, therefore, hygienically separates human waste from human contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.\r\nSufficient living area � A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room. Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally, housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of children under five per room may also be viable. However, the number of persons per room has been shown to correlate with adverse health risks and is more commonly collected through household surveys (UN-Habitat, 1998).\r\nStructural quality/durability of dwellings � A house is considered as �durable� if it is built on a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity. The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings: permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor; compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way � rail , highway, airport, power lines).\r\nSecurity of tenure � Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one�s home with security, peace and dignity (A/HRC/25/54). Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions. Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into the computation of the people living in slums.\r\nb. Informal Settlements � Informal settlements are not only found in the developing world, but they thrive in the developed world, too. Similarly, informal housing units are not poverty�s peculiarity, but they belong to all income levels. Therefore, informal settlements can be defined (United Nations, 2015; UN-Habitat, 2015b) as residential areas where: 1) inhabitants have no security of tenure vis-�-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing, 2) the neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, basic services and formal city infrastructure and 3) the housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations, is often situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal permit. Informal settlements can be a form of real estate speculation for all income levels of urban residents, affluent and poor. Slums are the poorest and most dilapidated form of informal settlements.\r\nInformality should be understood as a technicality more than an income-based denomination that stigmatises the poor, therefore informal settlements� estimates should be based on a technical compliance relevant to all income levels. For example, an approved municipal permit for any given housing unit would be a clear indication of formality. If municipalities lack the capacity to deliver such a permit, this is an administrative gap that this indicator will also point out. Most likely, municipalities will be eager to collect the necessary data, as municipal permits entail municipal revenue.\r\nc. Inadequate Housing � Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes �adequate housing� as one of the components of the right to adequate standards of living for all. Adequate housing must provide more than four walls and a roof. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights� general comments No.4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and No.7 (1997) on forced evictions have underlined that the right to adequate housing should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. For housing to be adequate, it must, at a minimum, meet the following criteria: 1) Legal security of tenure, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats; 2) Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse disposal; 3) Affordability, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants� enjoyment of other human rights; 4) Habitability, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats to health and structural hazards; 5) Accessibility, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters); 6) Location, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; 7) Cultural adequacy, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account the expression of cultural identity and ways of life.\r\nThe measurement of �inadequate housing� is meant to complement that of slums, and informal settlements particularly in the developed world where the �slum household� definition is less applicable, ensuring the universality of Indicator 11.1. Even though countries with available data could measure the full spectrum of the adequate housing components, for the purpose of measurability it is recommended that only one of the elements of the adequate housing definition is selected for measurement. Affordability is not only a key housing adequacy criterion, but it is the most suitable means of measurement for inadequate housing, as affordability increasingly becomes a global crisis with strong negative impact on the wellbeing of people and on the exacerbation of urban inequality. The underlying principle is that households financial costs associated with housing should not threaten or compromise the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs such as, food, education, access to health care, transport, etc. Based on the existing method and data through the Urban Indicators Program (1996-2006), affordability is measured as the net monthly expenditure on housing cost that exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household."

We have scheduled several technical workshops and EGMs that will help build the capacity for reporting in the first 3 years of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nIn the case of security of tenure, its complicated relation with land and property makes it a difficult aspect to include in the different related surveys and, therefore, to measure and monitor due to lack of routine data. However, the most recent years, important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into major surveys and censuses in several countries.\r\nAlso, Indicator 11.1 does not capture homelessness, as it is not included in household surveys.\r\nFinally, many countries still have limited capacities for data management, data collection and monitoring, and continue to grapple with limited data on large or densely populated geographical areas. This means that complementarity in data reporting will be key to ensure that both national and global figures achieve consistencies in the final reported data."
