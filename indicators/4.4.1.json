It is also one of the Partnerships on Measuring ICT for Development�s Core List of Indicators, which was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2014.\r\nThe indicator is based on the responses provided by interviewees regarding certain computer-related activities that they have carried out in a reference period of time. However, it is not a direct assessment of skills nor do we know if those activities were undertaken effectively.\r\nOne main issue is that the definition of IEA assessment does not include programming while ITU definition does. Although both have application meaning using computer and computer with internet connection as a tool in everyday life, IEA's assessment of ICT skills definition is more restricted as compare to ITU's definition. If a common framework is to be established the definition of both will need to be harmonized."
