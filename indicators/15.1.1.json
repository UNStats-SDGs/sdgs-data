The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development.\r\nChanges in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural sector.\r\nForest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are sustainably managed.\r\nThe indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator\r\n7.1 \"Proportion of land covered by forest\")."

                    "content": "In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of \r\n\"Forest\" and \"Total Land Area\". \r\nAccording to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as: \"land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use\". More specifically:\r\n� Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.\r\n� It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.\r\n� It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.\r\n� It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.\r\n� It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.\r\n� It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.\r\n� It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.\r\n� It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.\r\n� It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the \"Taungya\" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.\r\nTotal land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes. \r\nThe indicator is expressed as percent."

Access to remote sensing imagery has improved in recent years, but remote sensing techniques have limitations. In particular there are limitations to assess land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land cover), and some slow changes such as forest regrowth cannot easily be observed with remote sensing techniques and require long time periods in order to detect. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques."
