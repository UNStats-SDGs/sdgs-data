It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can\r\nbe used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search."

They comprise: (a) employed persons \"at work\", i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour; (b) employed persons \"not at work\" due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements (such as shift work, flexitime and compensatory leave for overtime)\r\nThe labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment."

In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization."

The Global Employment Trends Model (GET Model) is used to produce estimates, in particular, on unemployment (among others). It uses multivariate regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level. The first step is to assemble every known piece of real information (i.e. every real data point), and keep only data that are national in coverage and comparable across countries and over time. This is an important selection criterion when GET Models are run, because they are designed to use the relationship between the various labour market indicators and their macroeconomic correlates � such as per capita GDP, GDP growth rates, demographic trends, country membership in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC), geographical indicators, and country and time dummy variables � in order to produce estimates of the labour market indicators where no data exist. Thus, the comparability of the labour market data that are used as inputs in the imputation models is essential to ensure that the models accurately capture the relationship between the labour market indicators and the macroeconomic variables. The last step of the estimation procedure occurs once the datasets containing both real and imputed labour market data have been assembled. In this step, the data are aggregated across countries to produce the final world and regional estimates. For further information on the GET Models, please refer to the technical background papers available at the following website: http://www.ilo.org/empelm/projects/WCMS_114246/lang--en/index.htm."
