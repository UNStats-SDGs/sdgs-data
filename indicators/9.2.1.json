For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA is estimated in terms of  constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2010."

MVA measures the contribution of manufacturing to economy. The indicator is exceptionally good for international comparison. Share of MVA in GDP establishes the role of manufacturing in the economy. In other words, this indicator specifies the contribution of the manufacturing sector to total production. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a countryï¿½s level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. And finally, the MVA growth provides insight into the general direction and magnitude of growth for the manufacturing sector. In practice, it is a measure of the rate of change that an economy's MVA goes through from one year to another at constant prices."
