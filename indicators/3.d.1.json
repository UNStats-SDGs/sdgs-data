Eight core capacities are defined in this document.\r\nIndicator: a variable that can be measured repeatedly (directly or indirectly) over time to reveal change in a system. It can be qualitative or quantitative, allowing the objective measurement of the progress of a programme or event. The quantitative measurements need to be interpreted in the broader context, taking other sources of information (e.g. supervisory reports and special studies) into consideration and they should be supplemented with qualitative information.\r\nThe capability levels: Each attribute has been assigned a level of maturity, or a �capability level.� Attainment of a given capability level requires that all attributes at lower levels are in place. In the checklist, the status of core capacity development is measured at four capability levels: Level < 1: prerequisites (foundational level); Level 1: inputs and processes; Level 2: outputs and outcomes; Level 3: additional."
