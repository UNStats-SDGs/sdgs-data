It is important to understand that �fear of crime� is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that may be even largely independent from actual experience, as the perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is mediated by a number of factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion and the media and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, the �fear of crime� is an important indicator in itself as a high level of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and activities and thus an obstacle to development."

Further guidance on measuring the indicator are currently elaborated by UNODC in collaboration with victimization survey experts.\r\nIn 2010 UNODC-UNECE published a Manual on Victimization Surveys that provides technical guidance on the implementation of such surveys, on the basis of good practices developed at country level. UNODC-UNECE Manual on Victimization Surveys (2010), available at: https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Manual_on_Victimization_surveys_2009_web.pdf\r\nVictimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age)."
