Cities that improve and sustain the use of public space, including streets, enhance community cohesion, civic identity, and quality of life. Having access to open public spaces does not only improve the quality of life: it is also a first step toward civic empowerment and greater access to institutional and political spaces. \r\nCities function in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner only when private and public spaces work in a symbiotic relationship to enhance each other. In optimal conditions, they need to be secured and laid out in advance of urbanization to ensure orderly urban expansion. In existing cities, there is a need to revise and expand the ratio of public space in cities to make them more efficient, prosperous and sustainable. And they are needed in adequate amounts. Uncontrolled rapid urbanization creates disorderly settlement patterns with dangerously low shares of public space. Many cities in developed countries are also experiencing a dramatic reduce of public space.\r\nThe road network is the integrative tissue that binds cities together. It organizes the geographic space of cities, integrates them both as job markets and as local political spaces.\r\nCities that are walkable and transit-friendly require a highly connected network of paths and streets around small, permeable blocks. A tight network of paths and streets offering multiple routes to many destinations also make walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable. This has clear implications in making cities more energy efficient.\r\nAdequate public spaces in cities contribute to the achievement of other targets of Goal 11 and have positive implications in various Sustainable Development Goals. Notably public spaces increase social cohesion, networks and human exchange."

Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area. Delimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration and calculate the total area (square kilometers). Land use maps, inventories to be locally generated to identify public spaces if possible complemented by fieldwork.\r\nb. Computation of total area of open public space. Map and calculate the total areas of open public space within the defined urban boundaries based on the built-up area. The inventory of open public spaces is digitalized and vectorised using GIS software to allow computation of surfaces. The total of open public area is divided by the total built-up area of the city to obtain the proportion of land allocated to public spaces.\r\nc. Estimation of the land allocated to streets. Calculation of the total area allocated to streets based on sampling techniques with a random sample of 10 hectares locales is selected out of a complete listing of the all hectares locales that form the city, using the built-up area definition indicated above."

Measuring how much public space a city has is only one part of measuring whether residents actually benefit from the space.\r\nGaps in the currently available data for monitoring target 11.7 along with some recommendations of upcoming opportunities for filling such gaps are provided below. As a new and innovative indicator, data availability may be scarce. Many cities do not have an inventory of public space, or have one that is not up-to date. Efforts should be done to expand the availability of data in the developing world. UN-Habitat has developed tools, programmes and guidelines to assist cities in measuring, and expanding the availability of public space in cities. Some cities in the developing world lack of formal recognized public space that are publicly maintained. Innovative tools like the use of satellite imagery, and community-based mapping can support the identification of open space in public use.\r\nThe indicator quantifies the amount of open space in public use in cities, but does not capture the quality of the space that may impede its proper use. However, it is a precondition that open space is existing, and that its public use is guaranteed, to allow city authorities and other stakeholders to further improve its quality and increase its use."
