The 7th edition was released in October 2015.\r\nThe following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. \r\nResearch and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge � including knowledge of humankind, culture and society � and to devise new applications of available knowledge.\r\nExpenditures on intramural R&D represent the amount of money spent on R&D that is performed within a reporting unit."

In agreement with these three organisations, their data (which were collected from their member states/associated member states � around 65 countries-) are directly obtained from the respective databases (in the case of the OECD and Eurostat) or received from the partner (in the case of RICYT). There is also collaboration in Africa with the African STI Indicators Initiative (ASTII) of AU/NEPAD, which may lead to a joint data collection in the future. \r\nFor the data UIS sends a questionnaire to, the process is the following:\r\n(i): a questionnaire is sent to focal points in countries, generally within the Ministry of Science and Technology or the national statistical office.\r\n(ii) UIS processes the questionnaires, communicating with the countries in case of questions, calculates indicators and releases the data and indicators on its website. \r\n(iii) Countries are requested to complete the questionnaire using the standard international classifications, therefore adjustments are generally not needed."
