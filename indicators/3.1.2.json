When disaggregated by relevant socio-economic and geographic stratifiers, the indicator helps identified areas and groups that are not being reached with appropriate delivery care. The indicator, however, indicates only contact with a qualified health personnel and does not provide an indication of the quality of care provided or whether women receive all necessary interventions."

Most data from low and middle income countries are from household surveys and therefore based on women�s recall of the health worker who mainly assisted with delivery and their perception of the type of cadre (whether doctor, nurse, midwife or other). In addition, definition of skilled health personnel varies largely across countries, and includes non-standard list of cadres of health workers, which can lead to serious misclassification in terms of skills. Furthermore, categories of cadres of health workers used in survey questions are not standard but vary across surveys and between countries. Finally, the indicator only provides an indication of level of contact with the health system. It does not indicate level of quality of care, nor receipt of all necessary high impact interventions."

Nationally representative household surveys include surveys such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS, mics.unicef.org) and the USAID-funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS, dhsprogram.com). These surveys use nationally representative samples based on a two-stage cluster sampling, generally using a population census frame of enumeration areas. Final sample size includes several thousand households. Interviews are carried out with head of households, all women of reproductive age (generally 15-49) and, in the case of MICS, mothers/caretakers of children under-five. Denominator for the indicator is based on all live births reported by women of reproductive age on period up to five years preceding the survey. Despite slight variation in the determination of the denomination between surveys (for example, MICS uses last live births in the past two years while DHS uses all lives births in the past five years), the level of the indicator has been fairly comparable across surveys and overtime. \r\nData from health facility records are reliable only in countries where almost all deliveries occur in health facilities, resulting in generally very high level of births attended by skilled health personnel."

The web-based system is complemented by an online search carried out by WHO of survey reports and data published in countries.

In these cases, data presented in survey reports may be different from those reported in the global databases."
