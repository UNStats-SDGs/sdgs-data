Further there are indirect links to \"malnutrition\": Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a thousand million people. A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution to the eradication of hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial in adapting to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions, including climate change. They are the animal breeder�s raw material and amongst the farmer�s most essential inputs. They are essential for sustainable agricultural production.\r\nNo increase of the percentage of breeds being at risk or being extinct is directly related to \"halt the loss of biodiversity\"."

The risk class is considered to be \"unknown\" if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point).\r\nLinks to official definitions/descriptions of the indicator are reported below:\r\nThe indicator is one out of a set of 3 sub-indicators which are defined in the document CGRFA/WG-AnGR-7/12/7 \"Targets and indicators for animal genetic resources\" (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me514e.pdf) and that are endorsed in their current form by the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its the 14th Session (see par 28 CRRFA-14/13/Report at http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf). \r\nThe indicator serves to monitor the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources. In this respect the indicator is presented in the \"Status and Trends of Animal Genetic Rescources-2014\" (see http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm278e.pdf).\r\nRisk classes are defined as follows (see also FAO. 2007. The State of the World�s Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, edited by Barbara Rischkowsky & Dafydd Pilling. Rome. Accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1250e/a1250e00.htm.):\r\n� Extinct: a breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females remaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved which would allow recreation of the breed. In reality, extinction may be realized well before the loss of the last animal or genetic material.\r\n� Critical: a breed is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less than or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five; or the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not classified as extinct.\r\n� Critical-maintained: are those critical populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions.\r\n� Endangered: a breed is categorized as endangered if the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1 000 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population size is greater than 80 and less than 100 and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or the overall population size is greater than 1 000 and less than or equal to 1 200 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned to any of above categories.\r\n� Endangered-maintained: are those endangered populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions.\r\n� Breed at risk: a breed that has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, or endangered-maintained."
