In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered \"developed\" regions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations M.49 statistical standard which includes designation of \"developed regions\" and \"developing regions\", while an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations \"developed\" and developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process."
