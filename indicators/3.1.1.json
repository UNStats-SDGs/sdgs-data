As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator�s true value lies close to the point-estimate."

The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.\r\nii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).\r\nThe maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.\r\nBy contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population (see Box A2.2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15�49 years.\r\nRelated Statistical measures of maternal mortality\r\nMaternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.\r\nMaternal mortality rate (MMRate): Number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age.\r\nAdult lifetime risk of maternal death: The probability that a 15-year-old woman will die eventually from a maternal cause.\r\nThe proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM): The number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women aged 15�49 years."

Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.\r\nThe maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account.\r\nBecause maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or over-time comparisons.\r\nTo reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio.\r\nCensuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success.\r\nReproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify maternal deaths; no single source identifies all the deaths. Interviews with household members and health-care providers and reviews of facility records are used to classify the deaths as maternal or otherwise. If properly conducted, this approach provides a fairly complete estimation of maternal mortality (in the absence of reliable routine registration systems) and could provide subnational MMRs. However, inadequate identification of all deaths of reproductive-aged women results in underestimation of maternal mortality levels. This approach can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive to undertake � particularly on a large scale. The number of live births used in the computation may not be accurate, especially in settings where most women deliver at home. \r\nWHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division and The World Bank have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.\r\nData on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation.\r\nCurrently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country-reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories � those with no appropriate maternal mortality data -- a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality. It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins within which the true levels are known to lie.\r\nDetails on adjustments and formulas are published/available here:\r\n(1) http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/194254/1/9789241565141_eng.pdf?ua=1\r\n (2) Alkema L, Chou D, Hogan D, Zhang S, Moller A, Gemmill A et al.

                    "content": "The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the \"proportion maternal\", or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. \r\nIn other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:\r\nPM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 \r\nand then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:\r\nMMR=PM �(All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)\r\nwhere the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 2015.\r\nWith this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:\r\n1. Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.\r\n2. The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined \"maternal\" deaths; misclassification; or undercounting). \r\n3. The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2015, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. \r\n4. Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk"

This database is used to determine the number of maternal deaths and where possible the number of deaths among all women of reproductive age (WRA) to calculate the \"PM\" proportion of maternal deaths among WRA. The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where \"D\" is the number of deaths in women aged 15-49 (WRA) and \"B\" is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects.\r\nStatistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable Country, Regional, and Global level estimates. The model's fit is assessed by cross-validation. Estimates are then reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB.107.R8) seeking to \"establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions\". A key objective of this consultation process is \"to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used\". Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.\r\nThe country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.\r\nAdjustments are made according to the data source type:\r\n(1) CRVS, for underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths\r\n(2) reports providing \"pregnancy-related\" mortality, for underreporting of these deaths, as well as over-reporting of maternal deaths due to inclusion of deaths which are accidental or incidental to pregnancy (thus outside of the definition of maternal mortality). \r\nThe analysis also accounts for stochastic errors due to the general rarity of maternal deaths, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error."
