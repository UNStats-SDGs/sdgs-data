First of all, exports value should be always kept into account in order to observe whether changes in export shares are originating from increasing developing and LDCs exports or from a decrease of other countries exported values. Secondly, and in order to foster trade that is beneficial for the other SDGs, it would be useful to analyze the composition of the export basket by the level of processing of the goods that are traded. This will allow understanding whether progress are made in terms of the quality and value added of the products exported. In addition to that, while some exports like arms, oil and other natural resources would require a separate analysis, the calculation of export diversification indicators would be recommended to assess the progress made by developing and LDCs in terms of productivity and improvement of their export portfolio.\r\nFor what concerns trade in services, it could be necessary to draw on supplementary data from migration, tourism, multinational companies (MNC) and labour market statistics, in order to provide detailed figures for Travel and Government services n.i.e. A typical area of interest for international trade in services relates to the data that may be maintained by governments on education and health services provided to or by non-residents (travel; personal, cultural and recreational services). Information obtained from partner countries is useful in order to validate and improve statistics of the compiling economy. Data from international organizations can be useful for aid recipient countries to compile data on technical assistance services."

It has to be kept in mind however imports are often reported CIF (i.e. including the cost of freight and insurance) while export FoB (i.e. free on board).
