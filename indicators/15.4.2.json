Monitoring mountain vegetation changes over time provides an adequate measure of the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the mountain \"Green Cover Index\" over time can provide information on the forest, woody and vegetal cover in general. For instance, its reduction will be generally linked to overgrazing, land clearing, urbanization, forest exploitation, timber extraction, fuelwood collection, fire. Its increase will be due to vegetation growth possibly linked to land restoration, reforestation or afforestation programmes."

It builds upon very high resolution multi-temporal images from Google Earth and Bing Maps and Landsat 7 and 8 datasets from Google Earth Engine. Data and images are stored and globally available for any year from 2000, making possible the monitoring of the change over time. \r\nThe indicator has a global accuracy of 99%, but at national level for small countries the degree of accuracy is lower. This will be improved over time as more countries expand the data collection within their territory. \r\nData on mountain coverage are provided by the 2015 FAO/MPS global map of mountains."

The satellite data will be analyzed using Collect Earth.\r\nCollect Earth is a tool that enables data collection through augmented visual interpretation of high resolution imagery using Google Earth. In conjunction with Google Earth, Bing Maps and Google Earth Engine, users can analyze high and very high resolution satellite imagery and historical trends in vegetation. It can be used to collect data at the local, regional and global level and has been successfully used by many country partners (Papua New Guinea, Tunisia, Uruguay, others)."
