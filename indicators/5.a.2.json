As a result, Proxy c) may not be applicable to all countries."

Government funds should be earmarked for that purpose and channelled through a specific body (fund). \r\nMonitoring: This proxy aims to identify any policy objectives, draft provisions, existing legal provisions and implementing legislation that commit the government to the creation and maintenance of a fund for women�s access to land and/or access to productive resources and services.\r\nProxy b)\r\nTitle: Is joint titling of private property compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives for married or unmarried couples, in accordance with national law?\r\nRationale: Legal provisions on joint ownership of private property are not always a guarantee of women�s equal rights to land ownership or control. Without the inclusion of their names on the land title, deed or certificate, women�s property rights remain insecure, particularly if they are divorced, separated or widowed. \r\nMonitoring: This proxy aims to identify any policy objectives, draft provisions, existing legal provisions and implementing legislation that:\r\n� Make joint titling of private property compulsory for married or unmarried couples\r\n� Make joint titling the default option in registration\r\n� Encourage joint titling of private property for married or unmarried couples through economic incentives such as (inter alia):\r\nWaiver of registration fees for joint registration\r\nReduced registration fees for joint registration\r\nExemption from paying registration taxes \r\nCredit incentives\r\nProxy c)\r\nTitle: In recognised customary tenure systems, does the law facilitate the recording of all interests in land (including use rights) of men and women? \r\nRationale: This proxy applies to countries that operate a dual system of land tenure (ie. a statutory system of land tenure and a formally recognised customary system of land tenure). \r\nThe terms \"all interests in land\" are understood as all the rights in or over land. They may include the right to own, use, develop and control the lands that communities possess by way of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they have acquired. Where individual rights within a community are registered, provisions should be in place for the rights of both men and women to be registered. \r\nMonitoring: This proxy aims to identify any policy objectives, draft provisions, existing legal provisions and implementing legislation that organise the recording of customary rights to land of men and women.\r\nNota bene: Policy objectives, draft provisions, existing legal provisions and implementing legislation should facilitate the recording of the rights. Any time limits on applications, or caps on the surface area, would have the effect of restricting the ability to register these rights and should therefore be avoided."

Other possible entities include Human Rights Commissions, Gender Equality Commissions or any other relevant body. \r\nStep 2: Identification of a national legal expert\r\nConsidering the legal nature of Indicator 5.a.2, the Responsible Entity should consider appointing a national legal expert to perform the legal review.\r\nRecommended expert profile: \r\nThe national legal expert should be able to demonstrate knowledge and experience in issues related to property rights in his/her country, be able to locate relevant policy and legal material pertaining to land and property rights and be fluent in English.\r\nStep 3: Expert analysis of the policy and legal framework\r\nNature of the review\r\nFor the purpose of reporting under Indicator 5.a.2, FAO recommends that the national legal expert fills out the three forms attached (in Annex).\r\nForm 1 \"Checklist of policy and legal instruments\"\r\nThis form provides a checklist of the relevant policy and legal instruments to be screened for proxies. \r\nForm 2 \"List of policy and legal instruments for reporting under Indicator 5.a.2\"\r\nThis form should be used to facilitate reporting under Indicator 5.a.2. \r\nForm 3 \"Questionnaire on Indicator 5.a.2\"\r\nThis form summarises the results of the screening.\r\nStep 4: Validation of the results by the Responsible Entity\r\nThe results of the screening should be checked and validated by the Responsible Entity, prior to communication to FAO.\r\nStep 5: Communication of the results to FAO\r\nAfter checking and validating the results, the Responsible Entity communicates Forms 1, 2 and 3 to the custodian agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It is highly recommended that at this stage the Responsible Entity also informs the national statistical authority that will have the overall responsibility in coordinating SDG reporting at national level.\r\nStep 6: Validation of final indicator results with countries\r\nFAO will compute the indicator based on the information supplied by countries. It will communicate the result back to the national legal expert and seek final confirmation before reporting the indicator at global level."
