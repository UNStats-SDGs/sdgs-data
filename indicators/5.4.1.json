Domestic and care work includes food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of a dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household members, among others. \r\nTime spent on unpaid domestic and care work as well as on community or volunteer work constitutes the overall time spent on \"unpaid work\". Community or volunteer work includes volunteer services for organizations, unpaid community work, and informal help to other households, among other activities. Activities included in unpaid work are not included within the SNA production boundary but are part of the SNA General Production Boundary.\r\nAs much as possible, data compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics (ICATUS), according to which paid and unpaid work are delineated by the SNA production boundary."

                    "content": "Time use statistics have been used for: (a) the measurement and analysis of quality of life or general well-being; (b) a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid and volunteer work; and (c) for the improvement of estimates on the production of goods and services with particular emphasis on increasing visibility of womenï¿½s work through better statistics on their contribution to the economy and the development of satellite accounts.\r\nInternational comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: \r\n(a) diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. \r\n(b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. \r\n(c) Time-use data presented refer to the \"main activity\" only. Any \"secondary activity\" performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. \r\n(d) The different age groups presented by countries for their data also makes time use data incomparable across countries."

Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants only or (2) average time spent for all population of certain age. In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population. This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. \r\nData presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day. It is averaged over seven days of the week (weekdays and weekends are not differentiated)."
