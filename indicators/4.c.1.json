These figures may be published: (i) as observed data if the missing items are found in a national source; (ii) as national estimates if the country is persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data; or (iii) as UIS estimates, if the estimates are made by the UIS."

Publishable data are the data submitted to the UIS by Member States or the result of an explicit estimation made by the Institute based on pre-determined standards. In both cases, these data are sent to Member States for review before they are considered publishable by the UIS. \r\nWhen data are not available for all countries, the UIS imputes national data for the sole purpose of calculating regional averages. These imputed data are not published nor otherwise disseminated. \r\nWhere data are available for a country for both an earlier and a more recent year than the missing year, a simple linear interpolation is made. Where data are only available for an earlier year, the most recent value is used as an estimate. Similarly, where data are only available for a more recent year, the last value is used as an estimate.\r\nWhere the relevant data are not available at all for a country, estimates may be based on another variable which is clearly linked to the item being estimated. For example, trained teachers may be based on total teachers.\r\nWhere no data are available for the country in any year that can inform the estimate, the unweighted average for the region in which the country lies is used."

During this process countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.\r\nIn addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual \"country review\" of indicators."
