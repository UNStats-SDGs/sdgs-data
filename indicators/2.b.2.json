For Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules, the currency used in the notifications is similar to the one used in the Schedules.\r\nData are available by country and by products or groups of products, according to Members' schedules for Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules and according to Member's notification practices in the case of developing country Members using export subsidies under the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.\""
