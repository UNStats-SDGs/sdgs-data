If statistics are not disaggregated at the sub-major level, then major group 1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 could be used as a proxy."

Employed persons are all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work).

In cases where establishment surveys or administrative records are used, the coverage is likely to be limited to formal enterprises or enterprises of a certain size. Information on the enterprises covered should be provided with the figures. When comparing figures across years, any changes in the versions of ISCO that are used should be taken into account."
