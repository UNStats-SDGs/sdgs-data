The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with UN IGME-estimated under-five mortality rate. See the UN IGME link for details. \r\nFor the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:\r\nCivil registration: Number of children who died during the first 28 days of life and the number of births used to calculate neonatal mortality rates.\r\nCensus: Census often includes questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.\r\nSurveys: A direct method is used based on birth history a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from full birth history module."

                    "content": "The UN IGME estimates are derived based on national data. Countries often use one single source as their official estimates or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.\r\nMany countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of neonatal mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data. Data suffer from sampling or non-sampling errors (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Also the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also projects estimates to a common reference year. In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates, both national and interagency. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to other country estimates."

Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system which records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary source of data on under-five and neonatal mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.\r\nCivil registration\r\nCivil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of neonatal mortality rates are derived from the number of neonatal deaths and number of births over a period. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.\r\nPopulation census and household survey data\r\nThe majority of survey data comes from the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death."

UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). UNICEF also collects vital registration data reported by the Ministry of Health to WHO. \r\nAdjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of child mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UN IGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the neonatal mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data UN IGME adjusts the neonatal mortality estimates for crisis mortality.\r\nThen the UN IGME conducts a country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, notes on methodology etc. to National Statistical Office through UNICEF and to Ministry of Health through WHO for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Office and Ministry of Health review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data and send feedback or comments and sometimes additional empirical data if these data are not included in the UN IGME database.\r\nTo increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality database: CME Info (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME Info will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates."
